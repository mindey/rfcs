# Future AI Paradigm

One may define AI as artificial problem solving. People had for ages formulated problem as F(X)=Y in mathematics. It didn't change much:

1. **Past**: `dots` -> `line` -> `regression`
2. **Present**: `objects` -> `hypersurface` -> `deep learning`
3. **Future**: `concepts` -> `model` -> `search`

## Why?

The conceptual leap from regression to deep learning seem as radical as the leap from deep learning to search is. You may call `search` -- a `magic thinking`, that looks for new patterns in computational universes.

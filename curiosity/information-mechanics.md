# Information mechanics

## 0.
The Newton's laws talk about a "matter object", where the amount of matter is measured in KG. We can interpret this as the "information object", and measure the amount in "bits".

## 1.
The Newton's law of motion says that an object travels at a constant speed forever, if it is not affected by additional forces. The motion towards one direction is simple translation of coordinates.

We can formulate equivalent law of motion for objects to travel into the future, as a continuous translation of coordinates. The translation of information can be imagined as continuous process that copies the state from one time-slice to the adjacent time-slice without losing bits.

(For example, a crystal system of a rock may translate into the future without loss of information.)

## 2.
The Newton's law of motion says the object changes speed, if force is applied.

We can formulate equivalent law of information motion over the time dimension, if additional forces of entropy/extropy are applied.

If the entropy is thought of as bit mutation rate ("number of bits changed in a string of length N bits per unit of time t", e.g., Levenstein distance, or delta-Kolmogorov complexity), and the extropy can be thought of as a bit replication rate ("number of bits from N bit string copied over unit of time t"), then we can use these processes to construct a process where information evolution happens, determining the information content translation into future. (proliferation or decay can be thought of falling out of orbit, or escaping the orbit)

## 3.
The orbital mechanics says, that the orbit trajectory is a tradeoff of two forces - centrifugal force, and gravitational force.

We can formulate equivalent law of information motion, where entropy corresponds to gravitational force, and extropy corresponds to centrifugal force. Information object thus stays in orbit, as long as the information replication (compare: "height gain due to linear velocity") is compensating for the information loss due to entropy (compare: "height loss due to gravity").

Reaching the escape velocity (what rockets do) would then imply the information replication process, that replicates (or compresses and replicates) information so as to completely eliminate or prevent the information loss, and maximize the information gain.


# Engineering an information rocket

Information rocket could be thought of as a device that empowers the lossless (or gainful) translation of information processes that define the travelers across the time dimension, using engines, like replication (copying, transmitting) and compression systems for the information and information processes of our minds.

Compare:
```
(bits lost per unit of information content) per unit of time
(orbit height meters lost per unit of mass) per unit of time
```

```
(1 bit per 100 bit string) per second
(1 meter orbital height loss per 1 kg) per second
```

## Sources of entropy/extropy? Geometry of Entropy field?

- Entropy is high where temperature or disorder/chaos is high.
- Extropy is high where replication and compression rates are high. (note: compression correlates with good models and intelligence).

## Already existing technologies:
- copy cell nucleus (life) (+sex -> mutation=exploration of new optima)
- copy neural signals (brain)
- copy computer signals, disks, memory, processors, (internet)

## New technologies:

- intimate mind process exchange engines
 (people with shared interests exchange much personal data,
  and replicate each other's processes in each other's minds,
  e.g., - plan together, reason together, build together, trust each other, cooperate...)

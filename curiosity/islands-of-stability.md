# Islands of Stability

Entropy $$F$$ has trained mutating replicators to pursue goal $$Y$$ called *"information about the entropy to counteract it"*. This "information" is us. It is the world model $$F'$$, which happened to be the most helpful in solving our equation $$F(X)=Y$$ for actions $$X$$, maximizing our ability to counteract entropy, perhaps to the extent that one day we are able to reverse the flow of time.

## On Islands of Stability

Islands of stability exist for chemical elements, for life forms (mosquitoes are an island of stability among processes in existence, although they don't have to be very intelligent to persist). Humans are an island of stability too, and there may exist the islands of stability for the organizational structures, artificial life (AI systems) too, just not clear where exactly these islands of stability will be.

# End of time.
Stop is... when, the maximally stable model is achieved.

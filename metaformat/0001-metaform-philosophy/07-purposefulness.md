# 7. Purposefulness
(and realism)

## CONTEXT
- Formation of goals is equivalent to defining imaginary objects with desired properties.
- There is no easy way to tell, if an object represents a real or imaginary thing.
- There is no way to tell if the imaginary things represented are desired or not desired by the data source.

## DEFINITION
- **Data objects are realistic and purposeful, if there exists a standard way to indicate if the object by an author (data source) represents a real thing or an imaginary thing; a desired thing, an undesired thing, or a potentiality.**

## TEST CONDITIONS
- The data object has a mutable symbol to represent real/imaginary parts, and if the thing is desired, undesired, or of hypothetic desirability (e.g., a draft).

**NOTE**
- In combination of with algebraic tractability, the ability to identify desires, enables us to formulate objective functions as objects, and seek for transitions to states to transform the existing object to desired object. For example, if we write a scientific thesis, we may just describe the existing world as an object with reality as property, and then, define the desired world, with desire as property, and show some transition functions with potentiality as property.

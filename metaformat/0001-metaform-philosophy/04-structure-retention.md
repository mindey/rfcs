# 4. Structure-retention

## CONTEXT
- We love to define new home for the data we receive, and make it more query-able, but often the original data received gets transformed or discarded.

## DEFINITION
- **Data is structure-retaining, if the transformations made to it are reversible, or it is preserved in original form with a metaheader.**

## TEST CONDITIONS
- Are the transformations made to original data, reversible?
- Did the data remain in the original form after import?

# 6. Algebraic Tractability

## CONTEXT
Combining (e.g., taking LEGO parts or arbitrary components together) and working out differences (e.g., comparing apples to oranges) of complex objects is not trivial.
The same holds for complex data objects.

## DEFINITION
Data objects (records) are algebraically tractable, if for any two of them, the addition and subtraction operations are defined, and the result is an object with those operations defined with respect to the original data objects.

## TEST CONDITIONS
There is a program (algorithm) to add and subtract arbitrary data objects with metaheaders, and if it produces new objects with their metaheaders of the same metaformat.
